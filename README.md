# Salamander Fight Club: Heat-Induced Behavioral Plasticity in Plethodon Hybrids

Temperature is a mediator of performance in ectotherms. It may determine the range of behaviors that organisms are capable of completing, and it may also affect the conditions of survival in an ecosystem, driving behavioral thermoregulation. For communities of Plethodon salamanders, which may exist in high densities along a thermal gradient, it is important to understand how temperature changes may affect competitive ability. 

Previous research has described a trend towards increasing salamander aggression with warmer temperatures. It is thus far unclear how salamander hybrids, which may encroach on their parent populations and drive competitive exclusion, respond behaviorally to warming. In this thesis, I examine the effects of temperature on aggression and evasion in the Plethodon shermani and Plethodon teyahalee hybrid system. 

Though individuals from the parent populations exhibit heightened evasion and some increased aggression at higher temperatures (particularly within P. shermani), hybrid behavior seems largely unaffected by warming. Hybrids of the two populations exhibited no trend towards increasing aggression or evasion with temperature. Future research is needed to determine if these findings are a function of hybrid vigor, an extended thermal preference range, or a currently unknown aspect of hybrid physiology.
